# AES Cypher Marketing - Immediate Execution Plan

## Execute Everything Now (No Waiting)

All tasks can be completed in one session. I'll work through them systematically using browser automation.

---

## Execution Order (Prioritized by Impact)

### TIER 1: High-Impact Launches (Do First)
These have the highest visibility and should be done when you're available to monitor responses.

1. **Product Hunt Launch** - Biggest reach potential
2. **Hacker News Show HN** - Tech audience, high quality traffic
3. **Reddit r/macapps** - Direct target audience
4. **Reddit r/SideProject** - Indie maker community

**Why these first:** They require active engagement. You want to respond to comments quickly for maximum visibility.

---

### TIER 2: Directory Submissions (Do Immediately After)
These are "set and forget" - no ongoing engagement needed.

5. **AlternativeTo** - Gets indexed quickly, good for SEO
6. **MacUpdate** - Popular Mac software directory
7. **SourceForge** - Large user base
8. **Softpedia** - High traffic directory
9. **FileHippo** - Additional coverage

**Why these second:** They work in the background. Once submitted, they generate passive traffic.

---

### TIER 3: Additional Reddit Communities (Do Same Day)
Lower priority but still valuable.

10. **Reddit r/privacy** - Privacy-focused audience
11. **Reddit r/cybersecurity** - Security professionals
12. **Reddit r/Entrepreneur** - Business angle

**Why these third:** Good for niche audiences but lower volume than Tier 1.

---

### TIER 4: Content Publishing (Do Same Day)
Written content for SEO and authority.

13. **Medium Article** - "Why I Built AES Cypher"
14. **Dev.to Article** - Technical implementation
15. **Indie Hackers Post** - Launch story

**Why these last:** They provide long-term SEO value and can be published anytime.

---

### TIER 5: Social Media (Do Same Day)
Quick wins for immediate visibility.

16. **Twitter Launch Thread** - 5-tweet thread
17. **Twitter Engagement** - Reply to relevant tweets

**Why anytime:** Social media is ongoing and flexible.

## Pre-Written Content (Ready to Use)

### Product Hunt
**Name:** AES Cypher
**Tagline:** Mac encryption with automated password testing - no more manual trial-and-error
**Description:**
```
Ever encrypted a file and later couldn't remember which password you used?

AES Cypher solves this with automated batch password testing. Import your list of common passwords, and it automatically tests each one until it finds the right match.

Unlike VeraCrypt or Encrypto, AES Cypher is built specifically for this scenario:
• Import password lists (dozens or hundreds)
• Automatic testing with real-time progress
• Mac-native beautiful interface
• AES-256 encryption with PBKDF2
• 100% offline - no cloud, no tracking

Perfect for:
✅ Testing password variations you commonly use
✅ Accessing old encrypted files
✅ Saving time vs manual entry

Important note: AES-256 encryption can't be "cracked." This only works if the correct password is in your list.

$9.99 one-time payment. No subscription.
```

### Hacker News
**Title:** Show HN: AES Cypher – Mac encryption with batch password testing
**Text:**
```
Hi HN! I built AES Cypher because I kept running into a specific problem: encrypting files and later forgetting which of my common passwords I used.

Existing tools (VeraCrypt, Encrypto, 7-Zip) make you manually test each password. With 5-10 password variations I commonly use, this became tedious.

AES Cypher adds batch password testing: import a list, and it automatically tests each one.

Technical details:
- AES-256-CBC encryption
- PBKDF2 key derivation (100k iterations)
- Random salts and IVs per file
- Native Mac app (Python + Tkinter)
- 100% offline

Important: This isn't password cracking. AES-256 is unbreakable. It only works if the password is in your list.

Built for convenience, not security bypassing.

Would love feedback from the security-minded folks here!

### Reddit r/macapps
**Title:** I built a Mac encryption app with automated password testing
**Body:**
```
Hey r/macapps!

I just launched AES Cypher - a Mac encryption tool with a feature I couldn't find elsewhere: automated password testing.

**The Problem:**
You encrypt a file but later can't remember which password you used. You have 5-10 variations you commonly use, so you manually test each one. Tedious.

**The Solution:**
AES Cypher lets you import a password list and automatically tests each one until it finds the right match.

**Features:**
• AES-256 encryption
• Batch password testing
• Mac-native interface
• Dual encrypt/decrypt modes
• 100% offline
• $9.99 one-time (no subscription)

**What it's NOT:**
This isn't password cracking. AES-256 can't be broken. It only works if your password is in the list you provide.

Built this as an indie side project. Would love feedback from fellow Mac users!

### Twitter Thread
```
Tweet 1:
Launching AES Cypher today! 🔐

Mac encryption tool with automated password testing.

Problem: Encrypted a file but can't remember which password you used?

Solution: Import your password list, automatically test each one.

Thread 👇

Tweet 2:
Unlike VeraCrypt or Encrypto, AES Cypher includes batch password testing.

No more manually typing each password variation.

Import list → automatic testing → find password

Saves hours of frustration.

Tweet 3:
Features:
✅ AES-256 encryption
✅ Batch password testing
✅ Mac-native interface
✅ 100% offline
✅ $9.99 one-time (no subscription)

Perfect for testing your own password variations.

Tweet 4:
Important disclaimer:

AES-256 encryption is mathematically unbreakable.

This works ONLY if the password is in your list.

Not magic. Just convenient automation.

Tweet 5:
Built this as an indie maker solving my own problem.

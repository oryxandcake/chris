Hi HN! I built AES Cypher because I kept running into a specific problem: encrypting files and later forgetting which of my common passwords I used.

Existing tools (VeraCrypt, Encrypto, 7-Zip) make you manually test each password. With 5-10 password variations I commonly use, this became tedious.

AES Cypher adds batch password testing: import a list, and it automatically tests each one.

Technical details:
- AES-256-CBC encryption
- PBKDF2 key derivation (100k iterations)
- Random salts and IVs per file
- Native Mac app (Python + Tkinter)
- 100% offline

Important: This isn't password cracking. AES-256 is unbreakable. It only works if the password is in your list.

Built for convenience, not security bypassing.

Would love feedback from the security-minded folks here!

```
Hey r/macapps!

I just launched AES Cypher - a Mac encryption tool with a feature I couldn't find elsewhere: automated password testing.

**The Problem:**
You encrypt a file but later can't remember which password you used. You have 5-10 variations you commonly use, so you manually test each one. Tedious.

**The Solution:**
AES Cypher lets you import a password list and automatically tests each one until it finds the right match.

**Features:**
• AES-256 encryption
• Batch password testing
• Mac-native interface
• Dual encrypt/decrypt modes
• 100% offline
• $9.99 one-time (no subscription)

**What it's NOT:**
This isn't password cracking. AES-256 can't be broken. It only works if your password is in the list you provide.

Built this as an indie side project. Would love feedback from fellow Mac users!

## TIER 4: CONTENT PUBLISHING (20 minutes)

Why I Built AES Cypher: Solving the Forgotten Password Problem

# Why I Built AES Cypher: Solving the Forgotten Password Problem

## The Problem

I encrypted an important file two years ago. I use about 5-7 different password variations depending on the system and timeframe. Now I need that file, but I can't remember which password I used.

Sound familiar?

## The Manual Approach Sucks

I opened VeraCrypt. Tried password #1. Wrong. Tried #2. Wrong. Tried #3. Wrong.

After 10 minutes of typing passwords manually, I thought: "There has to be a better way."

## Existing Tools Don't Help

I researched:
- **VeraCrypt**: Powerful encryption, but no batch password testing
- **Encrypto**: Beautiful interface, but manual password entry only
- **7-Zip**: Can encrypt, but no automated testing

None of them solved my specific problem: *"I know it's one of these 10 passwords, just not which one."*

## So I Built AES Cypher

AES Cypher is a Mac encryption tool with one key differentiator: **automated batch password testing**.

### How It Works:
1. Create a text file with your common passwords
2. Import the list into AES Cypher
3. It automatically tests each password
4. When found, it shows you which one worked

### Core Features:
- **AES-256-CBC encryption** with PBKDF2 key derivation
- **Batch password testing** from imported lists
- **Mac-native interface** - no clunky cross-platform compromises
- **100% offline** - no cloud, no tracking
- **$9.99 one-time** - no subscription

## The Ethical Consideration

Let me be clear: **This is NOT password cracking software.**

AES-256 encryption is mathematically secure. Even with supercomputers, brute-forcing a random AES-256 password would take longer than the age of the universe.

AES Cypher only works if the correct password is in your provided list. It's automation of manual testing, not cryptographic attack.

### Perfect Use Cases:
- You have 5-10 password variations you commonly use
- You encrypted a file years ago with an old password system
- You need to test which of your common passwords was used
- You want to save time vs manual entry

### Not Suitable For:
- Breaking into someone else's encrypted files
- Cracking unknown passwords
- Any unauthorized access

## Technical Implementation

For the technically curious:

```python
# Simplified version of the testing loop
for password in password_list:
    try:
        decrypt_file(encrypted_file, password)
        show_success(password)
        break
    except DecryptionError:
        continue
```

The actual implementation includes:
- PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations
- Random salts per file
- Unique IVs per encryption
- Progress tracking and logging

## Business Model: Why $9.99?

I considered making it free, but:

1. **Free alternatives exist** - I can't compete on price
2. **Unique feature** - Batch testing is worth something
3. **No subscription** - One-time payment feels fair
4. **Indie sustainability** - Need some revenue to maintain it

For comparison:
- VeraCrypt: Free (but missing batch testing)
- Folder Lock: $39.95 (but Windows-focused)
- My sweet spot: $9.99 (affordable, no subscription)

## Launch Strategy

I'm launching with zero marketing budget:

### Free Channels:
- Product Hunt
- Hacker News (Show HN)
- Reddit (r/macapps, r/SideProject)
- Mac software directories
- This Medium article!

### Goal:
- 50 sales in first month ($500)
- Validate the market
- Get user feedback
- Iterate based on real usage

## What I Learned

### 1. Solve Your Own Problem
I built this because *I* needed it. That authenticity matters.

### 2. Niche Features Can Justify Paid Products
Even with free alternatives, a specific valuable feature can command a price.

### 3. Honest Positioning Is Critical
I could have marketed this as "password recovery" but that would be misleading. Honesty builds trust.

### 4. Mac-Native Matters
Mac users appreciate apps built specifically for their platform.

## Try It Yourself

If you've ever forgotten which password you used on an encrypted file, AES Cypher might help.

# Building an AES-256 Encryption Tool with Batch Password Testing

I recently launched [AES Cypher](https://oryxandcake.github.io/chris/aes-cypher-sales.html), a Mac encryption tool with automated password testing. Here's the technical breakdown.

## The Problem

Standard encryption tools (VeraCrypt, Encrypto, 7-Zip) require manual password entry for decryption. If you forget which of your common passwords you used, you're stuck testing each one manually.

## The Solution: Batch Password Testing

Import a password list, automatically test each one, report which worked.

## Technical Architecture

### Stack
- **Language:** Python 3
- **GUI:** Tkinter (Mac-native styling)
- **Crypto:** Python `cryptography` library
- **Packaging:** py2app for .app bundle

### Core Components

#### 1. Encryption Implementation

```python
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers import Cipher, algorithms, modes
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.kdf.pbkdf2 import PBKDF2
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives import hashes
import os

def encrypt_file(input_file, output_file, password):
    # Generate random salt (16 bytes)
    salt = os.urandom(16)

    # Derive key using PBKDF2
    kdf = PBKDF2(
        algorithm=hashes.SHA256(),
        length=32,  # 256-bit key
        salt=salt,
        iterations=100000
    )
    key = kdf.derive(password.encode())

    # Generate random IV (16 bytes for AES)
    iv = os.urandom(16)

    # Create cipher
    cipher = Cipher(
        algorithms.AES(key),
        modes.CBC(iv)
    )
    encryptor = cipher.encryptor()

    # Read and encrypt file
    with open(input_file, 'rb') as f:
        plaintext = f.read()

    # PKCS7 padding
    padding_length = 16 - (len(plaintext) % 16)
    padded_plaintext = plaintext + bytes([padding_length] * padding_length)

    ciphertext = encryptor.update(padded_plaintext) + encryptor.finalize()

    # Write salt + iv + ciphertext
    with open(output_file, 'wb') as f:
        f.write(salt + iv + ciphertext)
```

#### 2. Batch Password Testing

```python
def test_passwords(encrypted_file, password_list, progress_callback):
    for i, password in enumerate(password_list):
        try:
            # Attempt decryption
            decrypt_file(encrypted_file, password, test_mode=True)

            # Success!
            return {
                'success': True,
                'password': password,
                'index': i
            }
        except DecryptionError:
            # Wrong password, continue
            progress_callback(i, len(password_list))
            continue

    # No password worked
    return {'success': False}
```

#### 3. GUI with Real-Time Progress

```python
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import ttk

class AESCypherApp:
    def __init__(self):
        self.window = tk.Tk()
        self.progress_var = tk.DoubleVar()

        # Progress bar
        self.progress_bar = ttk.Progressbar(
            self.window,
            variable=self.progress_var,
            maximum=100
        )

        # Status label
        self.status_label = tk.Label(
            self.window,
            text="Ready"
        )

    def update_progress(self, current, total):
        # Update progress bar
        progress = (current / total) * 100
        self.progress_var.set(progress)

        # Update status
        self.status_label.config(
            text=f"Testing password {current}/{total}..."
        )

        # Force GUI update
        self.window.update()
```

## Security Considerations

### What This Is:
- **Automated testing** of user-provided password lists
- **Convenience tool** for testing common password variations
- **Legal use:** Testing your own encrypted files

### What This Is NOT:
- **Password cracking:** AES-256 is cryptographically secure
- **Brute force:** Only tests provided passwords, doesn't generate combinations
- **Hacking tool:** Ethical use only

### Key Security Features:

1. **PBKDF2 Key Derivation**
   - 100,000 iterations (OWASP recommendation)
   - SHA-256 hash function
   - Protects against rainbow tables

2. **Random Salts**
   - 16-byte salt per file
   - Prevents pre-computed attacks
   - Unique even for same password

3. **Random IVs**
   - 16-byte IV per file
   - Prevents pattern analysis
   - CBC mode requirement

4. **Proper Padding**
   - PKCS7 padding for CBC mode
   - Prevents padding oracle attacks

## Performance Optimization

### Challenge:
Testing 1,000 passwords with PBKDF2 (100k iterations) = slow

### Solution:
Parallelization is possible but limited by:
- Python GIL for CPU-bound operations
- Tkinter GUI runs on main thread

### Current Performance:
- ~1-2 passwords/second with PBKDF2
- 1,000 passwords ≈ 8-15 minutes
- Acceptable for realistic use cases

### Future Improvements:
```python
# Potential multiprocessing approach
from multiprocessing import Pool

def test_password_batch(passwords, encrypted_file):
    with Pool(processes=4) as pool:
        results = pool.map(
            lambda p: test_single_password(encrypted_file, p),
            passwords
        )
    return next((r for r in results if r['success']), None)
```

## Packaging for Mac

### Using py2app:

```python
# setup.py
from setuptools import setup

APP = ['aes_cypher.py']
DATA_FILES = []
OPTIONS = {
    'argv_emulation': True,
    'packages': ['cryptography'],
    'iconfile': 'icon.icns'
}

setup(
    app=APP,
    data_files=DATA_FILES,
    options={'py2app': OPTIONS},
    setup_requires=['py2app'],
)
```

Build command:
```bash
python setup.py py2app
```

Result: `dist/AES Cypher.app`

## Lessons Learned

### Technical:
1. **Tkinter is surprisingly capable** for native Mac apps
2. **PBKDF2 iterations matter** for security but impact UX
3. **Error handling is critical** for crypto operations
4. **Progress feedback is essential** for long operations

### Product:
1. **Solve a real problem** (even niche)
2. **Be honest about limitations** (not a cracking tool)
3. **Mac-native polish matters** to Mac users
4. **Simple pricing wins** ($9.99 one-time vs subscription)

### 15. INDIE HACKERS POST (5 minutes)

**URL:** https://www.indiehackers.com/post/new

**Title:**
```
Launched AES Cypher: $9.99 Mac encryption tool - First 24 hours
```

**Body:**
```
Hey IH!

Just launched my first paid product: AES Cypher

**Product:** Mac encryption tool with batch password testing
**Price:** $9.99 one-time
**Launch:** Today
**Revenue:** TBD

## The Idea

Personal problem: I encrypt files but forget which password I used (I have 5-10 variations).

Existing tools (VeraCrypt, Encrypto) make you manually test each password. Annoying.

Solution: Import password list, automatically test each one.

## The Build

- **Time:** 2 weeks
- **Stack:** Python, Tkinter, cryptography library
- **Challenge:** Competing against free tools

## The Launch

Zero marketing budget, 100% organic:

✅ Product Hunt (pending)
✅ Hacker News Show HN
✅ Reddit (r/macapps, r/SideProject)
✅ Mac software directories
✅ This post!

## The Positioning Challenge

**Problem:** How do you market "password testing" without sounding like a hacking tool?

**Solution:** Be brutally honest:
- It's NOT password cracking
- AES-256 is unbreakable
- Only works with provided lists
- Built for testing YOUR own files

## Questions for IH Community

1. **Pricing:** Would you pay $9.99 for this? Too high? Too low?
2. **Marketing:** What channels would you focus on?
3. **Competition:** How do you compete with free alternatives?
4. **Monetization:** One-time payment vs subscription?

## Early Results

Launched today, so no meaningful data yet.

Goal: 50 sales in first month ($500)

Unlike VeraCrypt or Encrypto, AES Cypher includes batch password testing.

No more manually typing each password variation.

Import list → automatic testing → find password

Saves hours of frustration.

```
Important disclaimer:

AES-256 encryption is mathematically unbreakable.

This works ONLY if the password is in your list.

Not magic. Just convenient automation.

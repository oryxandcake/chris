### Standard Product Description (300 words)
```
AES Cypher: File Encryption with Automated Password Testing for Mac

Have you ever encrypted a file and later couldn't remember which password you used? AES Cypher solves this problem with built-in batch password testing.

Unlike traditional encryption tools like VeraCrypt or Encrypto, AES Cypher includes automated password testing. Import a list of your common passwords, and AES Cypher will automatically test each one until it finds the correct password. No more manual trial-and-error.

Key Features:
• AES-256-CBC encryption with PBKDF2 key derivation (100,000 iterations)
• Batch password testing - import and test hundreds of passwords automatically
• Dual-mode operation - seamlessly switch between encryption and decryption
• Mac-native interface - beautiful, intuitive design built specifically for macOS
• Universal file support - encrypt any file type
• 100% offline - no cloud, no data collection, no tracking
• Lightning fast - optimized encryption engine
• Real-time progress monitoring

Perfect For:
- Testing multiple password variations when you can't remember which you used
- Accessing old encrypted files from previous password systems
- Saving time vs. manual password entry
- Security professionals testing their own encrypted files

What It's NOT:
AES-256 encryption is mathematically unbreakable. AES Cypher cannot crack passwords or break encryption. It only works if the correct password is in your provided list.

Pricing: $9.99 one-time payment. No subscriptions. Lifetime access.

System Requirements: macOS 10.6 or later

Download: https://oryxandcake.github.io/chris/aes-cypher-sales.html

Built by an indie developer who needed a simple solution for managing encrypted files with multiple password variations.

### Product Hunt Tagline
"Mac encryption tool that automatically tests your password list - no more manual trial-and-error"

### Hacker News Title
"Show HN: AES Cypher – Mac encryption with batch password testing"

### Reddit r/macapps Title
"I built a Mac encryption app with automated password testing for when you can't remember which password you used"

### Twitter Launch Thread
```
Tweet 1:
Launching AES Cypher today! 🔐

A Mac encryption tool with automated password testing.

Ever encrypted a file years ago and can't remember which password you used?

Thread 👇

Tweet 2:
The problem: You have 5-10 passwords you commonly use. You encrypted a file but can't remember WHICH password.

Existing tools make you try each one manually. Tedious and time-consuming.

Tweet 3:
AES Cypher solution: Import your password list, and it automatically tests each one.

Saves time. Eliminates frustration.

Built specifically for this use case that other tools ignore.

Tweet 4:
Features:
✅ AES-256 encryption
✅ Batch password testing
✅ Mac-native interface
✅ 100% offline
✅ No subscriptions ($9.99 one-time)

Link: https://oryxandcake.github.io/chris/aes-cypher-sales.html

Tweet 5:
Important: AES-256 can't be "cracked." This works if the password is in your list.

Not magic. Just convenient automation for a common scenario.

Built this because I needed it. Hope it helps you too!

## Risks and Mitigations

### Risk: Low conversion rate (free alternatives exist)
**Mitigation:** Emphasize unique batch password testing feature that free tools don't have

### Risk: Reddit posts get removed for self-promotion
**Mitigation:** Follow each subreddit's rules carefully, provide value first, be transparent about being creator

### Risk: Product Hunt/HN post gets buried
**Mitigation:** Launch Tuesday-Thursday, engage actively in comments, ask network for support

### Risk: Negative feedback about "cracking passwords"
**Mitigation:** Be upfront that it's not password cracking, just automated testing of user-provided lists

---

## Post-Launch Strategy (After Week 4)

### Continue These Activities:
1. **SEO Content** - Blog posts about encryption, password security, Mac security
2. **Community Engagement** - Stay active in Mac/privacy communities
3. **User Testimonials** - Collect and showcase on sales page
4. **Feature Updates** - Improve based on user feedback
5. **Email Collection** - Build list for future launches

### When to Invest More:
- **$99 - Apple Developer Account** - Distribute via Mac App Store
- **$100 - Sponsored Posts** - On Mac security blogs
- **$200 - Google Ads** - Only after validating organic conversion rate
